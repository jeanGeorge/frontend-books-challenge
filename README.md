# üìö Frontend Books Challenge
Welcome! This project is a virtual bookshelf, created with some recent frontend web development technologies. You can take a look at the current result [here](https://bookschallenge.vercel.app/). 

## üë®‚Äçüíª Stack
Technologies/tools used:
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Just [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) with types! How not to like scalability and safety?
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) framework for developing single page web applications. It's a personal choice, but with Next.js we have MANY benefits, such as Server Side Rendering, Static Site Generations, SEO improvements, among others...
- [Context.API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to manage the application state.
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to doc components

Below you can see how to configure and run the project locally and also my implementation decisions. Feel free to contact me for criticism or suggestions! My contacts are on my profile.

## üîß Project setup
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
